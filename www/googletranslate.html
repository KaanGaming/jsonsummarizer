    <h1 id="thegt">The Google Translate</h1>
    <p>You probably have heard of Google Translate. It's known for having the most language options available. But it also ends up being faulty, or just broken. But it still should give you an idea of what the text you are looking at means. Although it's not very reliable, it's still being preferred by everyone.</p>
    <p>You may also see this feature being added to other sites. For example, this website. The Google Translate tool can also be found in Google Chrome itself, it's a built-in feature. Most people use Google Chrome, but other people may prefer other browsers as well.</p>
    <h1 id="alts">Any alternatives to Google Translate?</h1>
    <p>While Google Translate may end up being faulty, you can still use other translates. Some may have just enough languages while serving a little better translation, some may translate ultimately accurate except they may support only few languages.</p>
    <h2 id="deepl">DeepL</h2>
    <p>You may know this one, but if not, it's not a problem. This thing lets you translate these languages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Chinese</li>
      <li>Dutch</li>
      <li>English</li>
      <li>French</li>
      <li>German</li>
      <li>Italian</li>
      <li>Japanese</li>
      <li>Polish</li>
      <li>Portuguese</li>
      <li>Russian</li>
      <li>Spanish</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Yes, it's an absolute behemoth. It support 12 languages, which may be a lot, but still may not include your language. While providing accurate translation, it supports a few languages. You can still use this tool to help yourself.</p>
    <p>It also has an API, but it requires a subscription which I can't afford for.</p>
